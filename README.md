## Options

You can make select from a few customisable options by appending a query string to the URL:

| Parameter      | Description                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?with-border` | Adds a silver border around the edge of the clock face.   |
| `?no-colon`    | Removes the colon between the hours and minutes.          |
| `?fixed-width` | Enforces a fixed width on the digits to prevent shifting. |
